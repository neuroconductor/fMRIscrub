Description: Collection of routines for data-driven scrubbing (projection 
    scrubbing and DVARS), motion scrubbing, and other fMRI denoising strategies
    such as anatomical CompCor, detrending, and nuisance regression. The
    data-driven scrubbing methods are also applicable to other outlier detection
    tasks involving high-dimensional data.
