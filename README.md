`fMRIscrub` is a collection of routines for data-driven scrubbing
(projection scrubbing and DVARS), motion scrubbing, and other fMRI
denoising strategies such as anatomical CompCor, detrending, and
nuisance regression. The data-driven scrubbing methods are also
applicable to other outlier detection tasks involving high-dimensional
data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of fMRIscrub from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mandymejia/fMRIscrub")
```

## Quick start guide

``` r
s_Dat1 <- scrub(Dat1)
plot(s_Dat1)
Dat1_cleaned <- Dat1[!s_Dat1$outlier_flag,]
```

## Data

Two scans from the [ABIDE
I](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/abide_I.html) are
included in `fMRIscrub`: `Dat1` has many artifacts whereas `Dat2` has
few visible artifacts. Both are vectorized sagittal slices stored as
numeric matrices. They are loaded into the environment upon loading the
package.

We acknowledge the corresponding funding for the ABIDE I data:
